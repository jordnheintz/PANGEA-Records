00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:16.000 align:middle line:90%
I learned the reason to become strong
Take me and go

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:25.760 align:middle line:84%
I feel dizzy by the muddy flashback

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:32.520 align:middle line:90%
That means you have something you want to grab hold of
That's all

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.880 align:middle line:84%
The scent of night

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.140 align:middle line:84%
(I'll spend all thirty nights)

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.360 align:middle line:84%
Even if I stare at the sky

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.780 align:middle line:84%
(Staring into the sky)

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.940 align:middle line:90%
The only thing you can change is yourself
That's all

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:59.900 align:middle line:90%
I learned the reason to become strong
Take me and go

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.660 align:middle line:90%
Dreams that you can't erase no matter what
An unstoppable "now"

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.000 align:middle line:84%
If you can become stronger for someone

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.060 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, sadness

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.920 align:middle line:84%
I learned why I lost when I was beaten up by the world

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:33.180 align:middle line:90%
Bloom, crimson lotus
Shine the fate

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:40.380 align:middle line:84%
The sound of lightning pierced my ears

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:47.560 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything you can protect just by being nice? I know

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.180 align:middle line:84%
Good and evil are entangled in water, divine punishment that can see clear hypocrisy

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.780 align:middle line:84%
(Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why, tell me... I don't need you!)

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.380 align:middle line:84%
One flower that continues to struggle for blossom is more beautiful than a gem

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.060 align:middle line:84%
Road full of sharp thorns

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:14.480 align:middle line:84%
It will only appear for me who means it

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.300 align:middle line:84%
Don't easily get rid of your dreams, even dreams that can't be protected

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:41.380 align:middle line:84%
This red lotus heart is rooted and lives in this blood

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:48.500 align:middle line:84%
Hidden secrets will disappear because they are scattered

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:55.620 align:middle line:84%
A heartbreaking wind scream that tore it apart

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:02.200 align:middle line:84%
A person's laughter and cry

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.880 align:middle line:84%
Everyone wants happiness

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.680 align:middle line:90%
Dreams that you can't erase no matter what
An unstoppable "now"

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.980 align:middle line:84%
If you can become stronger for someone

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.040 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, sadness

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.860 align:middle line:84%
I learned why I lost when I was beaten up by the world

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:41.960 align:middle line:90%
Bloom, crimson lotus
Shine the fate

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.960 align:middle line:84%
Shine the fate
